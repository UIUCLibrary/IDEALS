----------------------------------------------------------
Administrative Notes:

  (1) If the "Restricted to Group" specified above is the
      "Administrator" group, then the submitter will need 
      to be contacted regarding which group he/she wishes 
      to restrict to. In all other cases, no action should 
      be necessary!
      
  (2) Items under EMBARGO appear with a "Release Date"
      specified above.  If no "Restricted to Group" is
      specified, then these items will NOT be browseable
      or searchable until after the release date.  However,
      IDEALS Administrators can edit these items from the 
      Administration "Edit Item" interface, as necessary.
